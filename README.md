- ### Job Subscription

    The criteria for adding a job to a user's subscription list are as follows:

    1. **Company Match**: 
        - The job's company ID must be in the user's subscribed company IDs. 
        - If the user has an empty list of company IDs, this condition is considered satisfied.

    2. **Job Tag Match**: 
        - At least one of the job's tags must match the user's subscribed job tags. 
        - If the user has an empty list of job tags, this condition is also satisfied.

    3. **Location Match**: 
        - The job's location ID must be in the user's subscribed location IDs. 
        - If the user has an empty list of location IDs, this condition is considered satisfied.

    If all three conditions are met for a user, the job ID is added to their job notification list. If a user already has a job notification entry, the job ID is appended to their existing list. If no entry exists, a new job notification entry is created for the user with the job ID.
